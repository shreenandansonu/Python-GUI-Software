The notes include explanations, mathematical derivations, and relevant diagrams to aid understanding.\n",

    "## 1. Convolution in LTI Systems\n",
    "\n",
    "### Concept\n",
    "Convolution is a fundamental operation in LTI systems used to compute the output of a system given its **impulse response** and an arbitrary input.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Impulse Response**: The output of an LTI system when the input is an impulse function (Dirac delta function, δ(t)). Denoted as **h(t)**, it fully characterizes the system's input-output relationship.\n",
    "- **Convolution Operation**: For an input **x(t)** and impulse response **h(t)**, the output **y(t)** is given by the convolution integral:\n",
    "  \\[\n",
    "  y(t) = x(t) * h(t) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} x(\\tau) h(t - \\tau) d\\tau\n",
    "  \\]\n",
    "  This integral slides the flipped impulse response over the input signal, computing the output at each time **t**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Significance\n",
    "- If you know **h(t)**, you can compute the output for any input **x(t)** by convolving it with **h(t)**.\n",
    "- Convolution captures how the system responds to any input by summing the contributions of the impulse response scaled by the input.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Eigenfunctions of LTI Systems\n",
    "\n",
    "### Definition\n",
    "An **eigenfunction** of a system is an input function that, when applied, produces an output that is a scaled version of itself. For LTI systems, the eigenfunctions are **complex exponential signals** of the form:\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "x(t) = e^{st}, \\quad s = \\sigma + j\\omega\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "where **s** is a complex number, **σ** is the real part, and **ω** is the imaginary part.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Property\n",
    "When an exponential signal **e^{st}** is input to an LTI system, the output is:\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "y(t) = H(s) e^{st}\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "- **H(s)** is a complex number called the **eigenvalue** associated with the eigenfunction **e^{st}**.\n",
    "- **H(s)** is the **transfer function** evaluated at **s**, which we will discuss later.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Analogy to Linear Algebra\n",
    "- In linear algebra, an eigenvector **x** of a matrix **A** satisfies:\n",
    "  \\[\n",
    "  A x = \\lambda x\n",
    "  \\]\n",
    "  where **λ** is the eigenvalue.\n",
    "- In LTI systems, **e^{st}** is analogous to the eigenvector, and **H(s)** is analogous to the eigenvalue.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Laplace Transform\n",
    "\n",
    "### Definition\n",
    "The Laplace transform converts a time-domain signal into the s-domain, facilitating the analysis of LTI systems, especially for solving differential equations.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Unilateral Laplace Transform**:\n",
    "  \\[\n",
    "  X(s) = \\int_{0^-}^{\\infty} x(t) e^{-st} dt\n",
    "  \\]\n",
    "  - Used for causal systems (signals starting at **t = 0**).\n",
    "  - Assumes the signal is zero for **t < 0**.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Bilateral Laplace Transform**:\n",
    "  \\[\n",
    "  X(s) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} x(t) e^{-st} dt\n",
    "  \\]\n",
    "  - Considers the entire time axis, suitable for non-causal systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Application\n",
    "- The Laplace transform simplifies the solution of **linear constant coefficient differential equations** by converting them into algebraic equations in the s-domain.\n",
    "- For a differential equation, the Laplace transform of the derivative **dx(t)/dt** is:\n",
    "  \\[\n",
    "  \\mathcal{L}\\left\\{\\frac{dx(t)}{dt}\\right\\} = s X(s) - x(0^-)\n",
    "  \\]\n",
    "  Assuming initial conditions (e.g., **x(0^-) = 0**) simplifies the analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Transfer Function\n",
    "\n",
    "### Definition\n",
    "The **transfer function** **H(s)** of an LTI system is defined as the ratio of the Laplace transform of the output **Y(s)** to the Laplace transform of the input **X(s)**, assuming zero initial conditions:\n",
    "\\[\n",

    "  \\]\n",
    "- The magnitude **|H(jω)|** determines the amplification or attenuation of the input amplitude.\n",
    "- The phase **θ(ω)** indicates the phase shift of the output relative to the input.\n",
